  caveats do
    <<~EOS
      Kazumi may need to be allowed in System Settings â†’ Privacy & Security.

      If you see "Kazumi is damaged and can't be opened" when launching the app,
      try reinstalling with the --no-quarantine flag:

        brew reinstall --cask --no-quarantine kazumi

      This bypasses macOS Gatekeeper quarantine for unsigned applications.
